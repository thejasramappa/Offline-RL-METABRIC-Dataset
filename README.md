## üìå Project Overview
Offline-RL-METABRIC-Dataset applies Offline Reinforcement Learning using the METABRIC breast cancer dataset to optimize treatment strategies. Implements Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) with d3rlpy, modeling clinical features as states, treatments as actions, and survival outcomes as rewards for better therapy recommendations. This project investigates the use of **Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL)** techniques to optimize **personalized breast cancer treatment decisions** using the **METABRIC clinical dataset**.  

The system frames the clinical decision-making process as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**:
- **States** ‚Üí Patient clinical features (e.g., tumor size, receptor status, age)
- **Actions** ‚Üí Treatment strategies (e.g., chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiotherapy)
- **Rewards** ‚Üí Survival outcomes and recurrence rates

By leveraging **historical patient data**, we develop a **data-driven, interpretable RL model** that provides **personalized treatment recommendations** while ensuring patient safety by avoiding live experimentation.
